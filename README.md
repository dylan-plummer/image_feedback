# image_feedback
A video feedback simulator in Java.


The code outputs an image for each iteration creating a video showing the creation of each pattern.
A demonstration of this can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4KPOMTTe6k)

The input image is rotated, scaled, and mirrored before being drawn on top of itself.

This ends up generating some rather complex patterns from just a few simple rules.

Try messing around with different parameters to generate different patterns.
